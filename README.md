# TodoBoard
This is a simple todolist app I built in my free time where you can categorize your lists into what are called boards.

Say, for example, you can maintain different lists for the works that need to be done at your workplace, home,
college, etc. Within each board multiple lists can be created, say, for kitchen, for bedroom, for bathroom,
for repairs, so on and so forth.

You can visit [this]() link to try it out.

**Note**: I tried to make it mobile compatible. Please try on your mobiles too. :p

Since, this is just a Vuejs try-out project, rendered as a static site, there are some things to keep in mind.

### Things to keep in mind:
1. There can be bugs.
2. There is no server linked login mechanism. Just signup using random details.
3. Your boards are saved in browser localStorage.
4. Board data **is preserved** across different signups. So, board data goes nowhere.
5. You can upload a profile picture but it is not uploaded anywhere.
